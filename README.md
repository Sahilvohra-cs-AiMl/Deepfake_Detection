# Deepfake_Detection
Deepfake detection involves identifying manipulated media, such as images, videos, or audio, that have been altered using artificial intelligence techniques

Project Overview
The Deepfake Detection project aims to develop a robust system that can identify and flag altered media, specifically focusing on detecting deepfake content. Deepfakes are synthetic media where a person's likeness is manipulated to create realistic but fake representations. The project leverages machine learning and computer vision techniques to distinguish between genuine and manipulated content.

Objectives
Data Collection and Preprocessing: Gather a diverse dataset of real and deepfake videos/images/audio. Preprocess the data for training and testing the detection model.

Feature Extraction: Identify and extract distinguishing features from the media that can indicate manipulation. This may include inconsistencies in facial expressions, lighting, shadows, audio anomalies, etc.

Model Development: Develop machine learning models, such as convolutional neural networks (CNNs) or recurrent neural networks (RNNs), to analyze the extracted features and classify the media as real or fake.

Model Training and Evaluation: Train the detection model using the prepared dataset and evaluate its performance using metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.

Model Deployment: Deploy the model as a user-friendly application or API that can analyze new media inputs and provide a likelihood score of the content being manipulated.

Continuous Improvement: Regularly update the model with new data and techniques to enhance detection accuracy as deepfake technology evolves.
